<h1>Being Home </h1>
  
 <p>Home
   Everyone is home
   you're ten years old, mom is in the kitchen, dad is watching tv and your siblings are all doing their own thing but everyone is home
   <p>
  
     
  <p>youre in your childhood room waiting for the day you can be on your own,you wanted to grow up so bad that you forgot to take in the comfort of home
  </h2> 
  <p>years passed and everyones moved out, your parents have aged and now have white hair and you wonder "where has all the time gone?" realizing you can't go back to when everyone was together, your siblings aren't in the room next door anymore and everyone has their own life to live, you realize you won't have family game nights anymore, going to school together and you realize, nothing will give you that feeling of "being home"
